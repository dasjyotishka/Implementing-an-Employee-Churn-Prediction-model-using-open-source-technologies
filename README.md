# Implementing an Employee Churn Prediction Model using open source technologies

This project was the outcome of the Corporate Reseach Project as a part of Masters in Data Sciences and Business Analytics program at ESSEC-CentraleSupelec and monitored by Deloitte.

In this study, we propose and evaluate a predictive model for employee churn using machine learning techniques.Employee churn poses significant challenges to organizations in terms of productivity, knowledge loss, and increased recruitment costs. Predicting and mitigating
employee churn has become a critical aspect of human resource management. 

This project combined several of the most popular MLOps tools to showcase what the  workflow would look like using these tools, from experimentation to production. The experimentation loop uses Jupyter, MLflow, and Git. The production loop consists of Git, Airflow, MLflow, and FlaskAPI.
