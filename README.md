# Implementing an Employee Churn Prediction Model using open source technologies
Employee churn poses significant challenges to organizations in terms of productivity, knowledge loss, and increased recruitment costs. Predicting and mitigating
employee churn has become a critical aspect of human resource management. In this study, we propose and evaluate a predictive model for employee churn using machine learning techniques.

This project combined several of the most popular MLOps tools to showcase what the  workflow would look like using these tools, from experimentation to production. The experimentation loop uses Jupyter, MLflow, and Git. The production loop consists of Git, Airflow, MLflow, and FlaskAPI.
